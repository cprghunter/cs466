Environment: We used Python3.8, but it should work on Python3.7 as well.
Instructions:
    For running InduceC45:
    python3 InduceC45.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> [<restrictionsFile>]

    For running Classifier
    python3 Classifier.py <CSVFile> <JSONFile>

    For running validation
    python3 validation.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> [<restrictionsFile>] <K-fold value>
    If you want to change the threshold for validation, line 125 of validation.py 
    contains a float called "threshold" to adjust as desired.
