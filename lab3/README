Environment: We used Python3.8, but it should work on Python3.7 as well.
Instructions:
    For running InduceC45:
    python3 InduceC45.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> [<restrictionsFile>]

    For running Classifier:
    python3 Classifier.py <CSVFile> <JSONFile>

    For running validation:
    python3 validation.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> [<restrictionsFile>] <K-fold value>
    If you want to change the threshold for validation, line 125 of validation.py 
    contains a float called "threshold" to adjust as desired.

    For running randomforest:
    python3 randomforest.py -d <TrainingSetFile.csv> -n numTrees -m numAttributes -k numDataPoints

    For running KNN:
    python3 KNN.py <TrainingSetFile.csv> k <normalize[0, 1]>
    0 means do not normalize, 1 means normalize numerical columns
